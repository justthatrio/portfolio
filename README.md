# Who I Am

My name is Rio and im a programmer born in 2002 in Canada. Since an extremely young age ive been enamoured with computers and programming. Before I even knew my multiplication tables up to ten, I could make a multipage website styled with css. However i quickly moved on from html and web languages and became interested in software and game development.

I am a great team player however I prefer to program by myself when given the chance. This is mostly due to the fact that not only am i very logistically minded im also extremely artistic despite having aphantasia. This is evedent in my project titled **BlockenStein**, a game where I am the sole programmer, 3d modeler, visual artist, ui designer and, sound designer. At the time of this being updated the project is not finished but is nearing its free alpha release extremely quickly

I am the kinda person with over a hundred thousand unfinished projects over my lifetime, however I am NOT the type of person to announce something publicly that I don't intend of finishing. This is because I beleive its sometimes importent to program things for fun with no intent on releasing them just to challenge what you know and push your minds limits. When you promise you will deliver something or are expected to release it, not doing so without a justified reason is a reflection of not only a lack of dedication but also just bad on your word and reputation.

## Description
Blockenstein is a cubic chunk based engine that runs mods written in a custom language called **FrankenType**. The base gameplay is written in a FrankenType mod named vanilla. The FrankenType language gets parsed into tables arrays and variable and is then interpreted by the various complex custom systems I have developed. The FrankenType language is essentially an extendable config file that can change add or remove anything added by any other mod. This means  mods can be loaded at runtime without having to restart the program. Currently in development is a node editor for the language aswell however it will not be available for the free alpha release as its not essential to create run or modify mods. The engine runs on a cubic chunk system with 3x3x3 chunks and a infinite build height aswell as infinite depth. 

One can jump straight in and begin playing without ever having to touch a mod, however mods will also provide the functionality to modify blocks and items textures and a automatic message in the mod selection menu and world mods list will indicate whether the mod is capable of modifying gameplay or is pureley aesthetic.
