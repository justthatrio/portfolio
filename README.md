# Who I Am

My name is Rio and I am a programmer born in 2002 in Canada. Since an extremely young age I have been enamored with computers and programming. Before I even knew my multiplication tables up to ten, I could make a multipage website styled with CSS. However I quickly moved on from HTML and web languages and became interested in software and game development.

I am a great team player however I prefer to program by myself when given the chance. This is mostly due to the fact that not only am I very logistically minded I am also extremely artistic despite having aphantasia. This is evident in my project titled **BlockenStein**, a game where I am the sole programmer, 3d modeler, visual artist, UI designer and, sound designer. At the time of this being updated the project is not finished and my time has been fully spent developing another title called Timber Mill, I chose to temporarily switch because the concept behind Timber Mill seemed much less explored and more of a challenge for myself to program. One day I intend on returning to the development of BlockenStein however, I would like to see through Timber Mill to its release and hopefully monetization first. 

I am the kinda person with over a hundred thousand unfinished projects over my lifetime, however I am NOT the type of person to announce something publicly that I don't intend on finishing. This is because I believe it's sometimes important to program things for fun with no intent on releasing them just to challenge what you know and push your minds limits. When you promise you will deliver something or are expected to release it, not doing so without a justified reason is a reflection of not only a lack of dedication but also just bad on your word and reputation.

## Description
Timber Mill is a free-to-play micro-transaction based platform that allows players to build and customize on a plot of land that can be loaded in and relocated to different lots each time logging in. In Timber Mill players harvest trees for resources to build and collect limited edition collectibles to either trade, display or, refund. The games core mechanic is players having the ability to set up factories to produce limited edition collectibles and sell them to other players shops that then sell the collectibles or resources they have purchased, created or collected. Players are given the freedom to play the game how they wish and can create their own individualized experience.

### My Vision
My vision for Timber Mill started as a modest intention to design a fun to play creative building game, and has been constantly expanding. My end goal is to create a user content curated platform, but while the project is still in its infancy stages I will be designing the content. I have in place extremely powerful custom-built systems for monetization and the core gameplay mechanics built, now my goal is adding finishing touches, finishing the website, securing approval with Xsolla for accepting player payments, building a community around my game by various means of social networking, and continuing to produce content for the virtual shop and collectibles system.

## Description
Blockenstein is a cubic chunk based engine that runs mods written in a custom language called **FrankenType**. The base gameplay is written in a FrankenType mod named vanilla. The FrankenType language gets parsed into tables arrays and variables, the loaded data is then interpreted by the various complex custom systems I have developed. The FrankenType language is essentially an extendable con fig file that can change add or remove anything added by itself or any other mod. This means mods can be loaded at run time without having to restart the program. Currently in development is a node editor for the language as well however it will not be available for the free alpha release as its not essential to create run or modify mods. The engine runs on a cubic chunk system with 3x3x3 chunks and a infinite build height as well as infinite depth. 

One can jump straight in and begin playing without ever having to touch a mod, however mods will also provide the functionality to modify blocks and items textures and a automatic message in the mod selection menu and world mods list will indicate whether the mod is capable of modifying gameplay or is purely aesthetic.

### My Vision
My vision for BlockenStein is a fully customizable base where anyone with lots to no experience programming can jump in and make their own cubic mini game or survival experience or enjoy playing the default one or even their friends. The beauty of developing a game around being modifiable is you put the players experience in their own hands, you not only allow them to make their own choices in your game environment but also shape the environment itself past your intended use cases.
I understand that having nothing to start with could be overwhelming and aside from being an engine I want there to be default gameplay associated with it. This is why im making Vanilla, a mod for the engine written in FrankenType. This mod is automatically preinstalled when downloading the game and added to newly created worlds. I am dedicated to making vanilla as unique as a experience as possible. Its imperative people see past the games similarities to some preexisting titles and understand its individuality. I will ensure of that by adding extremely unique blocks and items and intentionally avoiding adding the things that are already preexisting in alternative tiles.


The point is.. Let your mad scientist out and see what crazy mad creations you can come up with!

please note this is a screenshot taken 2 days after the project was started, yes address is spelled wrong and yes it's hard to understand what's going on and no there isn't a way of scrolling. This is all guaranteed to change by the time I release the download for free.

## Description
Before explaining this program I wanna make it clear this is not something I plan on finishing but once it's more functional I will release it for free. My plan for this program is to create an extremely modern UI to display block chains with a focus on exposing where money is coming from and where it's going in an extremely readable way. The premise is a user will be able to enter a wallets address then they can label that wallet and always know who it belongs to on the graph in a seconds glance. When they enter a wallet the transaction history of that wallet is displayed as nodes in a graph organized left to right by time, and organized vertically automatically by each wallet visible on screen. Only the first 4 letters of a unlabeled nodes hash is visible at a glance, but clicking the node will display all the information about it include the full hash and money in account at the time of that transaction happening or allow you to relabel the node. Selecting a wallet node and clicking view history, will load its transaction history into the same graph your viewing. Therefore you will be able to see side by side when each transaction in each wallet took place and see wires connecting between the wallets wherever they made transactions to each other.
Gone will be the days of jumping between a million tabs when investigating crypto fraud trying to correlate the relations.

I have now begun working on this project alongside BlockenStein, because I love creating custom unique functioning interfaces. I started using the Blockchain API for retrieving transaction history data however after being rate limited by IP for days for making 2 requests right after one another, I have switched to the blockcypher API. This allows for me to retrieve more information and I haven't encountered any rate limiting despite lots of subsequent testing.
