# Who I Am

My name is Rio and im a programmer born in 2002 in Canada. Since an extremely young age ive been enamoured with computers and programming. Before I even knew my multiplication tables up to ten, I could make a multipage website styled with css. However i quickly moved on from html and web languages and became interested in software and game development.

I am a great team player however I prefer to program by myself when given the chance. This is mostly due to the fact that not only am I very logistically minded im also extremely artistic despite having aphantasia. This is evedent in my project titled **BlockenStein**, a game where I am the sole programmer, 3d modeler, visual artist, ui designer and, sound designer. At the time of this being updated the project is not finished but is nearing its free alpha release extremely quickly

I am the kinda person with over a hundred thousand unfinished projects over my lifetime, however I am NOT the type of person to announce something publicly that I don't intend of finishing. This is because I beleive its sometimes important to program things for fun with no intent on releasing them just to challenge what you know and push your minds limits. When you promise you will deliver something or are expected to release it, not doing so without a justified reason is a reflection of not only a lack of dedication but also just bad on your word and reputation.

## Description
Blockenstein is a cubic chunk based engine that runs mods written in a custom language called **FrankenType**. The base gameplay is written in a FrankenType mod named vanilla. The FrankenType language gets parsed into tables arrays and variables, the loaded data is then interpreted by the various complex custom systems I have developed. The FrankenType language is essentially an extendable config file that can change add or remove anything added by itself or any other mod. This means mods can be loaded at runtime without having to restart the program. Currently in development is a node editor for the language aswell however it will not be available for the free alpha release as its not essential to create run or modify mods. The engine runs on a cubic chunk system with 3x3x3 chunks and a infinite build height aswell as infinite depth. 

One can jump straight in and begin playing without ever having to touch a mod, however mods will also provide the functionality to modify blocks and items textures and a automatic message in the mod selection menu and world mods list will indicate whether the mod is capable of modifying gameplay or is pureley aesthetic.

### My vision
My vision for BlockenStein is a fully customizable base where anyone with lots to no expeirience programming can jump in and make their own cubic minigame or surivival expeirience or enjoy playing the default one or even their friends. The beauty of developing a game around being modfyable is you put the players experience in their own hands, you not only allow them to make their own choices in your game enviroment but also shape the envirment itself past your intended use cases.
I understand that having nothing to start with could be overwhelming and aside from being an engine I want there to be default gameplay associated with it. This is why im making Vanilla, a mod for the engine written in FrankenType. This mod is automatically preinstalled when downloading the game and added to newly created worlds. I am dedicated to making vanilla as unique as a experience as possible. its imperitive people see past the games similarities to some preexisting titles and understand its individuality. I will ensure of that by adding extremely unique blocks and items and intentionally avoiding adding the things that are already prexisting in alternative tiles.


The point is.. let your mad scientist out and see what crazy mad creations you can come up with!

## Description
My plan for this program is to create an extremely modern ui to display blockchains with a focus on exposing where money is coming from and where its going in an extremely readable way. The premise is a user will be able to enter a wallets hash then they can label that wallet and always know who it belongs to on the graph in a seconds glance. when they enter a wallet the transaction history of that wallet is displayed as nodes in a graph organized left to right by time, and organized vertically automatically by each wallet visible on screen. Only the first 4 letters of a unlabled nodes hash is visible at a glance, but clicking the node will display all the information about it including the full hash and money in account at the time of that transaction happening or allow you to relabel the node. Selecting a wallet node and clicking view history, will load its transaction history into the same graph your viewing. Therefore you will be able to see side by side when each transaction in each wallet took place and see wires connecting between the wallets wherever they made transactions to each other.
gone will be the days of jumping between a millions tabs when investigating crypto fraud trying to correlate the relations.

I have now begun working on this project alongside BlockenStein, because I love creating custom unique functioning interfaces. I realized you do not need an api key inorder to use the Blockchain API for retreiving transaction history data.
